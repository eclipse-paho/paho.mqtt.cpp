# Eclipse Paho MQTT C++ client library

This repository contains the source code for the [Eclipse Paho](http://eclipse.org/paho) MQTT C++ client library on memory managed operating systems such as Linux/Posix and Windows.

This code builds a library which enables C++11 applications to connect to an [MQTT](http://mqtt.org) broker to publish messages, and to subscribe to topics and receive published messages.

Both synchronous and asynchronous modes of operation are supported.

This code requires the [Paho C library](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c) by Ian Craggs

## Building from source

### Linux

The library uses C++11 features, and thus requires a conforming compiler such as g++ 4.8 or above.
The C++ library can be built against the current release version of the Paho C library or the latest 
development tree, if it is stable.

To build against the release version of the C library, download, build, and install the library as described
[here](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c)

Then clone the C++ library and build:

```
$ git clone https://git.eclipse.org/r/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.cpp
$ cd paho.mqtt.cpp
$ make
```

To build against the latest C development branch, fFirst, clone the C library repository, checkout the *develop* branch and build in-place (you don't need to install).

```
$ git clone https://git.eclipse.org/r/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.c
$ cd paho.mqtt.c
$ git branch develop
$ make
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/build/output
$ cd ..
```

Then clone the C++ library at the same directory level as the C library, and build the C++ library with the DEVELOP flag set:

```
$ git clone https://git.eclipse.org/r/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.cpp
$ cd paho.mqtt.cpp
$ make DEVELOP=1
```

This will use the latest C headers and libraries from the local workspace.

### Windows

TBD

## Example

Sample applications can be found in src/samples.

```
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    sample_mem_persistence persist;
    mqtt::client client(ADDRESS, CLIENTID, &persist);
    
    callback cb;
    client.set_callback(cb);

    mqtt::connect_options connOpts;
    connOpts.set_keep_alive_interval(20);
    connOpts.set_clean_session(true);

    try {
        std::cout << "Connecting..." << std::flush;
        client.connect(connOpts);
        std::cout << "OK" << std::endl;

        // First use a message pointer.

        std::cout << "Sending message..." << std::flush;
        mqtt::message_ptr pubmsg = std::make_shared(PAYLOAD1);
        pubmsg->set_qos(QOS);
        client.publish(TOPIC, pubmsg);
        std::cout << "OK" << std::endl;

        // Now try with itemized publish.

        std::cout << "Sending next message..." << std::flush;
        client.publish(TOPIC, PAYLOAD2, strlen(PAYLOAD2)+1, 0, false);
        std::cout << "OK" << std::endl;

        // Now try with a listener, but no token

        std::cout << "Sending final message..." << std::flush;
        pubmsg = std::make_shared(PAYLOAD3);
        pubmsg->set_qos(QOS);
        client.publish(TOPIC, pubmsg);
        std::cout << "OK" << std::endl;

        // Disconnect
        std::cout << "Disconnecting..." << std::flush;
        client.disconnect();
        std::cout << "OK" << std::endl;
    }
    catch (const mqtt::persistence_exception& exc) {
        std::cerr << "Persistence Error: " << exc.what() << " ["
            << exc.get_reason_code() << "]" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    catch (const mqtt::exception& exc) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << exc.what() << " ["
            << exc.get_reason_code() << "]" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
